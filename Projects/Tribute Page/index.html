        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Bro. Eliseo's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1947</strong> - Two years after the second World War, 
              Triunfo Soriano and Catalina Fernando had the seventh of their 
              eight children. Bro. Eli was born Eliseo Fernando Soriano on April
              4, 1947 in Pasay City, Metro Manila.
            <br><br>
            Bro. Eli’s father worked as a foreman for an engineering company, 
            while his mother took care of him and his siblings. Bro. Eli’s 
            parents were already members of the Church of God by that time, 
            being both baptized in 1934.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1956</strong> - He grew up a shy child and would go to his 
            room whenever there were guests in their house. 
            <br><br>
            It’s no wonder then
            that he entered elementary school a year late, and even then, he 
            would find clever ways to avoid class (e.g. sliding down a muddy 
            slope on the way to school).
            <br><br>
            That would all change come recognition day when he saw one of his 
            classmates go up the stage with the kid’s parents putting a medal 
            around his neck. Asking his parents about it, they told him that the
            medal was given to those who studied hard and got the highest grades.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1960</strong> - From not wanting to go to class to teaching 
            it, Bro. Eli became an assistant and substitute teacher in school. 
            He was also a consistent valedictorian and no less than the 
            president of the Student Council.
            <br><br>
            Just a few weeks shy of graduating however, Bro. Eli found knowledge
            and wisdom unlike anything he has read from all his textbooks in 
            class.
            <br><br>
            He then stopped attending high school (though his grade point 
            average with untaken quizzes and exams at the time qualified him for
            graduation) to learn a book whose words he had fallen in love with 
            — the Bible.
            <br><br>
            But as good love stories are, not everything was smooth at first.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1964</strong> - Somehow, the shy guy inside Bro. Eli still 
            had a bit of hold on him; whenever his parents would invite him to 
            go with them to Church gatherings, he would decline.
            <br><br>
            At one particular time, his father didn’t take anymore no for an 
            answer. So after a slap on the bottom with his father’s slipper, 
            young Bro. Eli was able to join his parents in listening to God’s 
            words.
            <br><br>
            As he listened to the biblical topic, which incidentally, was about 
            obeying one’s parents in the Lord, tears soon fell from his eyes. 
            They were no longer tears of pain from being reprimanded however, 
            but of repentance.
            <br><br>
            Back at home, young Bro. Eli locked himself in his room at 4 o’clock
            in the afternoon — and began reading from the Book of Genesis 
            onwards, until he had found the verse he heard earlier in the day. 
            He found it in the New Testament at 4 a.m. of the next day. No 
            dinner. No sleep.
            <br><br>
            Days later (despite the Presiding Minister not wanting to baptize 
            Bro. Eli yet as he was deemed too young then), Bro. Eli was born in 
            the spirit on April 7, 1964, just three days after his 17th birthday
            in the flesh.
            <br><br>
            Bro. Eli’s passion to learn more about God’s words only grew as time
            went by. Not long after being baptized, he expressed his desire to 
            become a Church worker, and soon attended ministerial classes under 
            Bro. Nicolas Perez.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1972</strong> - As time passed by, Bro. Eli would prove to 
            be a one-of-a-kind worker. Whichever locale he was assigned to, the 
            brethren there would become more active and happier in their service
            to the Lord.
            <br><br>
            He would become Bro. Perez’s transcriber in preparing topics to 
            serve the brethren with. And later on, though unknown to the other 
            workers and the brethren then, Bro. Perez trusted him to make the 
            topics himself.
            <br><br>
            Whenever there were debates against pastors of other religions, Bro.
            Eli was the choice of Bro. Perez amongst all.
            <br><br>
            His fate would then bring him miles away from Pasay: Pampanga, north
            of Manila.
            <br><br>
            There he would conduct Bible studies with a young Bro. Daniel Razon 
            — town after town through flooded rice fields and no-vehicle areas,
            countless nights of little or no sleep or food — which by the mercy
            of God, later resulted to the first locales in the region being 
            established.
            <br><br>
            Seeing the grace given unto him, Bro. Perez handed Bro. Eli in 1972 
            the only Church Minister title he would ever give to anyone before 
            the former passed away in 1975.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1980</strong> - The death of Bro. Perez without him formally
            declaring a rightful successor brought about many problems, 
            especially to Bro. Eli. The would-be leaders of their own future 
            religions connived against him, which eventually led to the Church 
            being divided into three.
            <br><br>
            Despite his efforts to bring the group together and his reluctance 
            to lead, he eventually heeded to the members’ and workers’ 
            (including those who have been in the ministry for far longer a time
            than him) plea to watch over them.
            <br><br>
            Thus, the Members Church of God the Pillar and Ground of the Truth 
            was registered in the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission 
            (SEC) in 1980.
            <br><br>
            Though Bro. Eli and the members faced adversity, another good thing 
            would happen that same year.
            <br><br>
            Preaching in Pampanga for 14 years and reaching only a number of 
            towns, Bro. Eli saw that he would need a hundred years or more just 
            to be able to cover the entire Philippines using traditional medium.
            <br><br>
            Thus, armed with no experience in broadcasting but with much 
            confidence in the Lord, the Ang Dating Daan (The Old Path) program 
            took off on DWWA 1206 kHz.
            <br><br>
            Shortly afterwards, Don Manolo Favis, a host of his own show on 
            DZBB, would take notice of Bro. Eli’s preaching and made him a 
            regular panelist on “Dis is Manolo and His GENIUS Family” (GENIUS 
            stood for God’s Eternal News In Universal Salvation).
            <br><br>
            The show featured pastors and preachers from various religions to 
            render their answers on questions and topics about life and the 
            Bible. As voted by his fellow panelists and Don Manolo himself, Bro.
            Eli received the Most Outstanding Minister award year after year 
            since he started there.
            <br><br>
            As time passed by, Bro. Eli Soriano would become the sole resource 
            person of the program — this, while Ang Dating Daan or ADD would 
            also air on DWAR, DZME, DZMD, DWAD, DWAN, DZXQ and in various local 
            radio stations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1983</strong> - The program soon gained its steady following
            , what with hearing live questions of faith answered via the air 
            waves — and three years after, it could also be seen.
            <br><br>
            The Ang Dating Daan program debuted on IBC 13 in 1983, and quite 
            miraculously at that.
            <br><br>
            The full production team consisted of only three persons: Bro. Eli, 
            the host (and cook); Bro. Daniel (who was still in high school then)
            , the director, editor, and every other technical need; and Sis. Luz
            Cruz, the executive producer, researcher and makeup artist.
            <br><br>
            Bro. Eli’s lumpia (spring rolls) and jeepneys for public use, Bro. 
            Daniel’s earnings from selling vegetables in the market during his 
            youth, and eventually, his salaries as a disc jockey and a broadcast
            journalist after college provided for the financial needs of the 
            program.
            <br><br>
            With such a setup, no sponsors, and a firm belief on not accepting 
            any financial contribution from its non-members, how could the 
            program survive one might ask?
            <br><br>
            Going well into the 90s, it proved that it didn’t just survive. It 
            flourished.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1994</strong> - What would later further propel the Ang 
            Dating Daan program began with an idea — or to be precise, a prayer.
            <br><br>
            Bro. Daniel had a personal request from God, mainly, on being a 
            small instrument in helping Bro. Eli bring the Gospel to a wider 
            audience. During a meeting with Church workers, he spoke of an idea 
            of inviting family and friends to a small gathering with a segment 
            wherein Bro. Eli could talk and they could ask him questions right 
            there and then. That was to be the birth of The Bible Exposition.
            <br><br>
            Bro. Eli became busier than ever. Apart from his broadcast schedules
            on radio and television, Bro. Soriano also held Bible Expositions in
            different locations across the country from covered basketball 
            courts, to stadiums and coliseums.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1999</strong> - With the Internet opening a new of avenue to
            connect with people across the planet, Bro. Eli and Bro. Daniel 
            launched www.AngDatingDaan.org in 1999. 
            <br><br>
            Just two years after, MCGI launched webtv.angdatingdaan.net, which 
            featured a 24-hour video streaming service of The Old Path program,
            giving instant access to its Q&A videos by anyone online.
            <br><br>
            The program and its Ask Bro. Eli, The Bible Will Answer format had 
            become more popular than ever within and beyond the Philippine 
            islands. Members were being baptized in different countries. And so 
            on January 13, 2004, the name of the Church was changed to a more 
            fitting truth: the Members Church of God International or MCGI.
            <br><br>
            The Old Path program, its host and staff also garnered accolades 
            from various award-giving bodies. Not to mention, the different 
            charities, such as Bible-giving and blood donation, that Bro. Eli 
            and Bro. Daniel had been carrying out since the 90s.
            <br><br>
            Of course, not everyone thought the same, for as with the most 
            well-meaning of intentions and actions since time immemorial, they 
            were not without controversy for others.
            <br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2005</strong> - Bro. Eli’s no-nonsense, scientific and 
            straight-from-the-Scriptures way of preaching had earned his name 
            its connotation with the word “Basa,” or “Read.”
            <br><br>
            For those who have listened to him preach even for just five 
            minutes, the term is an unmistakable staple and signal that the 
            statements following suit would be verses from the Bible.
            <br><br>
            The only time there would be quotes from different texts would 
            either be when referencing a scientific fact highlighting biblical 
            truths or a certain religion’s beliefs and practices from their 
            official books whenever answering a person’s inquiry.
            <br><br>
            While sincere research and transparency may be satisfying to a 
            person seeking truth, it doesn’t sound as sweet to pastors and 
            church leaders, especially, after not being able to stand against 
            the weight of truth in their debates with Bro. Eli.
            <br><br>
            From such roots sprouted the series of seemingly unfortunate events 
            that led Bro. Eli to leave the country for an indefinite return 
            period and preach abroad.
            <br><br>
            Probably born with a fear of heights, or rather, plunging from 
            air-thinning levels, Bro. Eli wasn’t keen on flying. Unless the 
            circumstances prevented so, he would often ride boats to go to 
            Philippine provinces far from the outskirts of the Luzon Island. 
            But his fate advised otherwise.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2007</strong> - Despite facing threats and difficulties 
            brought about by religious persecution, Bro. Eli’s preaching 
            continued in the Philippines and in other parts of the globe via 
            radio, TV and the World Wide Web.
            <br><br>
            And yet, Bro. Eli still looked for ways on how he can preach more 
            while being abroad. That is, apart from the Bible Expositions he 
            held in countries like Singapore, London, and the USA.
            <br><br>
            Just about three weeks after his 60th birthday, Bro. Eli published 
            his first two blogs: “Dissecting the Worst Mass Murder in American 
            History” and “Is There Another Earth?” at Esoriano.wordpress.com on 
            April 26, 2007.
            <br><br>
            The blog covered topics from love’s second chance to alternative 
            cures for bodily ailments. Most importantly, Holy Scriptural advice 
            for finding solutions to life’s questions and anything under or 
            light years away from the sun, for that matter.
            <br><br>
            In 2009, Mashable hailed the blog as the Most Educational to Follow 
            in its Open Web Awards.
            <br><br>
            Bro. Eli realized that there were a lot of other people of different
            races and languages waiting to know more about the Good News he 
            preaches. And he saw the scope of it all when he held a Bible 
            Exposition for the very first time in a country distant, but similar
            to his own.
          </li>
          <li><strong>2008</strong> - Brazil, as a nation, is predominantly 
            Catholic, much like the Philippines. At the time, Bro. Eli was 
            following the admonition of the Lord in Matthew 10:23 about being 
            persecuted, and kept in heart a prophecy in Jeremiah 51:45 of 
            where God’s nation will be called from.
            <br><br>
            With the help of a Portuguese interpreter he commissioned, Bro. Eli 
            put up a 30-minute program in Brazil, titled, O Caminho Antigo. 
            Surprisingly, within just a month of airing, letters came pouring in
            asking where they could reach him. And thus, the birth of the first 
            Bible Exposition there.
            <br><br>
            Not knowing how many people were going to show up, Bro. Eli reserved
            a rather cozy venue. But as the event neared, the number of people 
            who expressed interest in going — some even travelling for more 
            than 10 hours just to be there — was so unprecedented that Bro. Eli
            had to make last-minute arrangements to find a bigger place for the 
            event.
            <br><br>
            As Bro. Eli preached, there were tears, and laughter, and 
            testimonies of how almost incredible it was — that after 20 or 50 
            years of hearing different pastors in Brazil — it took someone from
            the East, a Filipino, for them to finally hear what they have been 
            longing to hear.
            <br><br>
            Later on, Bro. Eli found out, that it had been written all along:
            <br><br>
            For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same 
            my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place 
            incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my 
            name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.
            <br><br>
            — Malachi 1:11, KJV
            <br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2020</strong> - Now, there are over 400 hundred locales 
            across Brazil alone, and hundreds more in nearby Spanish-speaking 
            countries all the way up to Mexico. The number of Church members is 
            continually growing, with God’s help, and more and more people 
            around the world are being reached by The Old Path program. Today, 
            it is broadcast 24/7 via seven satellite providers, and even on 
            YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

            When the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) was declared a pandemic in 
            March 2020 and when various parts of the world were put on lockdown,
            Bro. Eli took it as an opportunity to engage people in listening to 
            the words of God while they were confined at home.

            In mid-April, The Old Path Live Bible Studies and Bible Expositions 
            began to be livestreamed daily, instead of weekly. These were on top
            of the regular schedules of Bible Expositions dedicated for 
            audiences in Portugal; Brazil; Europe, Israel, Africa, and the 
            Middle East; and India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.

            On June 1, 2020, The Old Path Live Mass Indoctrination sessions also
            started streaming on the web, giving more access to truth-seekers 
            who want to learn the doctrines of the Lord Jesus Christ.

            <strong>2021</strong> - After holding two consecutive Bible 
            Expositions in one day, God gave Bro. Eliseo Fernando Soriano his 
            well-deserved rest on February 10 in Brazil, but in the Philippines,
            it was already February 11.
            <br><br>
            An outpouring of sentiments and expressions of love and respect came
            in from people from all walks of life and various religions — from 
            those who constantly listened to The Old Path program, to the local 
            and national government officials, up to the president of the 
            nation.
            <br><br>
            Many things have changed over the years. And yet, despite the twists
            and turns of persecutions and hardships, days and nights of hard 
            work, and recurring attacks of asthma and joint pains, Bro. Eli 
            Soriano had remained a faithful servant of God and of the Lord Jesus
            Christ.  All he wanted was to propagate the Gospel of salvation, and
            to good unto all.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Bro. Eli may no longer be in our midst today, at least 
            physically, but his spirit continues to work and his legacy lives 
            on.</strong>
            <br><br>
            Bro. Eli’s passing is only a temporary repose.  As written in the 
            Apostle Paul’s first epistle to the Thessalonians, when the Lord 
            Jesus Christ returns, He will resurrect first all of those who died 
            in Him. 
            <br><br>
            <center><i>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, 
            with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God:  and 
            the dead in Christ shall rise first:
            <br><br>
            — 1 Thess. 4:16, KJV</i>
            </center>
            <br><br>
            <center>God willing, come the first resurrection, we shall have a reunion 
            with Bro. Eli and with all the other Christians who died in the 
            faith.  And together, we shall be part of the millennial reign of 
            the Lord Jesus Christ on earth. 
            </center>
            <br><br>
            <center><i>Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first 
            resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall
            be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand
            years.  
            <br><br>
            — Rev. 20:6, KJV</i>
            </center>
            <br><br>
            As to when this day is going to be, or as to how long are we still 
            going to wait, only God knows.  But while we await for the Lord 
            Jesus Christ’s return, the best we can do is to remain steadfast in 
            the faith, live by the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ until the 
            end, and never cease to do good deeds to all – as taught to us by 
            Bro. Eli Soriano.
